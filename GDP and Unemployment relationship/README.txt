! This project was made when i just started R and my master. I have made it for training purpose only !

1. Introduction
This mini-project was made after discovering the Okun's Law. 

Okun'w law is the trade that countries face between inflation and unemployment rate. Okun argue that unemployment and GDP have a negative correlation. 

I have gathered data from official websites ( Eurostat and World bank) to highlight graphically if the Okun's law was respected in European countries, specifically in Belgium.

2. Structure

After running the code, the repository is structured as follow:

	- Code: where you can both file to clean data and another one to compute necessary graphs
	- Data: Where data has been cleaned
	- Graph: When graphs (png or pdf) are stocked
	- RawData

A short pdf document where I've gathered the most important matters, and added some comments when needed.

3. Outcome

Okun's law, even though this theory was published in 1962, is still respected in most advanced countries in 2023.

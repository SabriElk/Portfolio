Portfolio Overview
================
Sabri Elk

# Introduction

This portfolio presents a curated selection of data‑driven projects
completed in economics, finance, and applied statistics. Each project
focuses on a concrete question, uses real or simulated datasets, and
applies analytical techniques ranging from econometrics and time‑series
modeling to machine learning and optimization.

The goal is to demonstrate a clear workflow: **problem → data → method →
results → interpretation**. All code, visualizations, and explanations
are included to allow full reproducibility.

# Skills Demonstrated

- **Programming:** R, Python
- **Econometrics:** regression modelling, panel data, causal inference
- **Time-Series Analysis:** ARIMA, VAR, forecasting techniques
- **Machine Learning:** classification, regression, cross‑validation
- **Finance:** asset pricing, risk measurement, portfolio optimization
- **Data Handling:** cleaning, transformation, visualization

# Featured Projects

## 1. Econometric Analysis

A set of applied econometrics projects illustrating: - Model
specification and diagnostics - Treatment effect estimation - Panel data
techniques

Each analysis includes code, model outputs, and interpretation of
results.

## 2. Time-Series Modelling

Projects focused on: - Forecasting macroeconomic indicators - Model
selection using AIC/BIC - Stability and stationarity analysis

Forecast accuracy and methodological comparisons are documented.

## 3. Machine Learning Applications

Examples include: - Predicting economic outcomes using linear and
nonlinear models - Model evaluation with appropriate metrics - Feature
engineering and regularization

Clear summaries highlight performance differences between algorithms.

## 4. Financial Modelling

Work related to: - Portfolio optimization - Risk measurement (VaR,
CVaR) - Asset‑return modelling

Visual summaries and scenario analysis accompany the code.

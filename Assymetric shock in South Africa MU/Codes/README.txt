Most of our code is based on the code provided by Professor Romain Houssa, regarding the class Global Macro-Financial Linkages

You will find in this repository :

- Quarterly GDP : This file contain the code and the database required to compute the quarterly GDP using the ChowLin Method.

- RawData : All data

- Routines : File containing every functions to assess our analisis

- Sign Restriction : This file include a data file and the code used to compute Sign Restriction estimation as required. Each file is designed to compute for each country

- Similarities : This file include data base used to compute the similarities amongst all countries. It also includes the correlation matrix extracted in an excel file and the graphs extracted from the code

- Sign restriction time trend : This file include a data file and the code used to compute Sign Restriction INCLUDING linear and quadratic time trend estimation as required.

- Zero Restriction : This file include a data file and the code used to compute zero Restriction estimation as required. Each file is designed to compute for each country

We would like to thanks Professor Romain Houssa for the provided code.

This analisis has been done several times by lots of economist. The purpose of this analisis is not to bring something new, but to apply my knowledge to real world data.

As a master student in Economic sciences, I would like to apply the knowledge in statistics, data analisis and econometrics. Here is my first side project, I wish you learn something insightful reading this.



1. Research Question

Understand the relationship between inflation rate and monetary policy driven by the BCE. This relationship has been highlighted in the past, but does it still holds ?


2. Data 

Inflation rate: Monthly, in % (statbel)

Employment date: Monthly (statbel)

GDP: Annualy, in millions (Eurostat)

4. Software used

Rstudio, Rmarkdown.

Packages will be needed, please run the code necesarry to download the packages before running the analisis.
